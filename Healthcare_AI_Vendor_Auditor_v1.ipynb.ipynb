In addition, certain third-party software which is not incorporated into the Filevine Services may be required to be loaded onto such computer or other device (each such device when properly installed with the required third party software to access the Filevine Services, is herein referred to as an “Authorized Device”) for Subscriber to access, use, or enjoy the full benefit of the Filevine Services (including, e.g., a compatible third party web browser). Subscriber shall be fully responsible for obtaining Authorized Devices for use by Subscriber’s Authorized Users at Subscriber’s own cost. Subscriber’s use of such separately acquired third party software shall be in accordance with any terms and conditions of the end user license agreement provided with such software.

    "Data Protection Agreement. The terms of the Filevine Data Protection Agreement (\"DPA\") are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and will apply to the extent Subscriber Data Includes personal information or personal data, as such terms are defined under applicable privacy or data protection laws (“Personal Information”). To the extent Personal Information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by Filevine, the Standard Contractual Clauses will apply, as further set forth in the DPA. For the purposes of Subscriber’s acceptance of this Agreement, execution of a Sales Order by Subscriber will be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses and related Appendices.\n",
    "Protection of Subscriber’s Data. Filevine will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Subscriber’s Data (including Subscriber’s Personal Information). Without limiting the foregoing, Subscriber acknowledges that certain initial release Filevine Services, as set forth in the Additional Product Terms (defined below) may not have been subjected to the same security or compliance scrutiny as the other Filevine Services. Filevine will not access, use or disclose Subscriber’s Data except to provide the Filevine Services and prevent or address service or technical problems, or at Subscriber’s request in connection with customer support matters. Although Filevine uses reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of such information, transmissions made on or through the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be secure.

    "Security and Compliance. Filevine and Subscriber acknowledge and agree that security and compliance is a shared responsibility between Filevine and Subscriber.  Subscriber assumes responsibility and management of its user accounts, permissions, Logon Credentials, private API keys and/or tokens, shared links, and other Subscriber specific access controls or components. Subscriber acknowledges that its responsibility for security and compliance may vary depending on the Filevine Services used, the integration of those services into Subscriber's IT environment, integration with third party systems, and applicable laws and regulations.  For more information regarding this shared responsibility model and a description of the measures Filevine takes please see https://www.filevine.com/security. \n",
    "Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Filevine strongly encourages Subscriber employ the following measures and disclaims all liability for security incidents caused by failure to take these or other appropriate measures: \n",
    "Use of strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) and daily review of audit or access logs to ensure only authorized parties are accessing Subscriber's Filevine environment.\n",
    "Secure use of Subscriber-generated Filevine links, password protection of these links and all aspects of shared access, guest access or documents Subscriber shares with its clients or third parties.\n",

Such additional product-specific terms and conditions are published at Filevine Product Specifications  (the \"Additional Product Terms\")and are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and will apply to the extent Subscriber subscribers for such Filevine Services hereunder\n",
    "In order to provide FilevineAI (as defined in the Additional Product Terms), Filevine may rely on AI technology provided by third-party artificial intelligence (AI) providers. By using FilevineAI, Subscriber acknowledges that there are numerous limitations to information, recommendations, suggestions or other output (collectively, “Output”) generated and returned by the such third party AI tools due to the fact that it is automatically generated, including that (a) it may contain errors or misleading information, (b) AI systems are based on predefined rules and algorithms that lack the ability to think creatively and come up with new ideas and can result in repetitive or formulaic content, (c) AI systems can struggle with understanding the nuances of language, including slang, idioms, and cultural references, which can result in Output that is out of context or does not make sense, (d) AI systems can perpetuate biases that are present in the data used to train them, and (e) AI systems can struggle with complex tasks that require reasoning, judgment and decision-making.  AI-generated information is made available solely for general information purposes. Subscriber should independently fact check AI-generated Output. Subscriber agrees that it is responsible for evaluating, and bearing all risks associated with, the use of any Output, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any Output.  It is Subscriber’s responsibility to evaluate whether AI outputs are appropriate for Subscriber’s use case, including where human review is appropriate, before using or sharing such Outputs. Filevine does not warrant the accuracy, currency, completeness, or usefulness of AI-generated Output. Any reliance Subscriber places on such Output is strictly at its own risk. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology. Subscriber and Filevine will work together in good faith on feedback, iterations, and improvements but Subscriber agrees that no specific results or product milestones are guaranteed by Filevine. \n",
    "Partner Implementation and Migration.\n",
    "Subscriber expressly acknowledges and understands that once Subscriber is provided access to the Filevine Services Subscriber can immediately use the full functionality of the core software. However, if Subscriber desires to avail itself of custom processes suited to its unique data and workflows, Subscriber must be fully implemented. Subscriber understands and acknowledges that: (i) Subscriber's failure to engage in good faith best efforts with an Implementation Partner (defined below) to implement the Filevine Services will delay Subscriber’s ability to avail itself of custom processes suited to its unique data and workflows; (ii) that Subscriber;s good faith efforts, including timely and responsive communication surrounding the implementation efforts are expected and relied upon by the Implementation Partner; and (ii) a successful and timely implementation cannot be completed absent Subscriber’s good faith best efforts and cooperation.\n",
    "Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Sales Order, Subscriber acknowledges and understands that Filevine will not perform or provide any implementation services and/or data migration services directly to or on behalf of Subscriber. Such implementation services and/or data migration services must be performed and provided by a Filevine-certified third-party implementation partner (the “Implementation Partner”). Filevine may provide Subscriber with a referral to such an Implementation Partner, who can perform and provide implementation and/or data migration services to Subscriber. Subscriber’s use of such Implementation Partner, including payment of the Implementation Partner’s fees, shall be exclusive of this Agreement, and shall be governed and dictated strictly by the terms of a separate agreement between the Implementation Partner and Subscriber. Subscriber expressly acknowledges and understands that Filevine is neither party to, nor responsible for any obligations under such third-party agreement, and Filevine hereby disclaims any liability associated therewith even if Filevine recommended or otherwise referred Subscriber to the applicable Implementation Partner. Filevine makes no warranties or representations, express or implied, regarding the results to be attained by using such third-party implementation services and hereby disclaims any such warranties, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. By signing this Agreement, Subscriber represents that it has contracted with an Implementation Partner, or that it will contract with an Implementation Partner within thirty (30) days following the execution of this Agreement and will use its best efforts to be implemented as soon as practicable. Neither Subscriber’s failure to contract with an Implementation Partner or implement the Services as contracted, nor the emergence of any issues pertaining to the quality or length of implementation will cancel, suspend, or terminate Subscriber’s obligation to pay fees under this Agreement for the remainder of the Term.\n",
    "Subscriber shall provide a primary and secondary point of contact to coordinate communication and keep Filevine apprised of progress during the Filevine Services implementation process with the Implementation Partner. Subscriber understands that completion of the implementation process is entirely dependent upon Subscriber’s timely and effective completion of responsibilities under the terms of its agreement with the Implementation Partner. \n",
    "Term and Termination.\n",
    "Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall remain in effect for the Term specified in the applicable Sales Order unless terminated sooner in accordance with this Agreement. If the applicable Sales Order is silent as to renewal terms, all subscriptions shall automatically renew for additional one (1) year renewal periods, unless either party provides thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party of its intent not to renew prior to the end of the then-current Term. Failure by Subscriber to comply with any terms of this Agreement, including any implementation requirements for any Filevine Services, shall not delay or modify the Term or any of Subscriber’s payment obligations hereunder or under any Sales Order. If Subscriber purchased the Filevine Services through a Reseller, the termination of Filevine’s agreement with such Reseller shall not automatically terminate Subscriber’s right to continue using the Filevine Services for the remainder of the applicable Term, provided Subscriber remains in compliance with this Agreement and continues to fulfill its payment obligations to the Reseller.\n",
    "Termination.  In the event Filevine reasonably suspects that illegal activity is occurring, or reasonably believes that a material security risk has, or will, occur, Filevine reserves the right, without any prior notice and without liability, in its sole and reasonable discretion, to suspend Subscriber’s access to the Filevine Services. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other Party if the other Party commits a non-remediable breach, or if the other Party fails to cure a remediable breach within ninety (90) days after being notified in writing of such breach, unless such breach is non-payment of fees due hereunder, in which case such breach must be cured within ten (10) days after being notified.\n",
    "Effects of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to Subscriber hereunder shall terminate and Subscriber’s and its Authorized Users shall immediately cease all use of the Filevine Services. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 8.1, any early termination of this Agreement does not cancel, suspend or terminate the obligation to pay fees for the remainder of the Term, and all fees paid in advance are non-refundable and Subscriber will not be entitled to a pro rata refund of any portion of such fees. \n",
    "Data Backup. Filevine shall not be obligated to store any Data for more than thirty (30) days following the expiration or termination of this Agreement by either Party. Within twenty (20) days following the date of termination or expiration, Subscriber shall notify Filevine, in writing, whether it would like the Data: (i) destroyed; or (ii) returned to Subscriber in a mutually agreed-upon format. Subscriber shall be solely responsible for all costs associated with such return. Upon written request, Filevine will provide to Subscriber a written certification of the deletion/destruction of Data. Filevine shall be permitted to retain copies of any Data for archival, legal and/or regulatory purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, Filevine may also continue to use data or information from Data as Anonymized Data (as defined in Section 7.2).\n",
    "Surviving Provisions. Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Filevine Subscription Agreement and payment terms contained in the applicable Sales Order will survive any termination of this Agreement, together with any remaining payment obligations owed by Subscriber to Filevine for Filevine Services and/or services under any schedules or addendums received prior to the effective date of expiration or termination.\n",
    "Pricing and Payment Terms.  All prices and terms set forth in the applicable Sales Order are to be regarded as Confidential Information of Filevine and are not to be disclosed to any third party without the prior express written consent of Filevine.\n",
    "Reseller Payment. If Subscriber purchases through a Reseller, Subscriber must pay all applicable amounts directly to the Reseller, and Subscriber’s order details will be specified in the Order placed by the Reseller with Filevine on Subscriber’s behalf.\n",
    "Overages. Overage fees, as identified in the Additional Product Terms, to the extent applicable, will be invoiced monthly in arrears.\n",
    "Late Fees. Overdue invoices shall incur interest at the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month and/or the highest rate allowed under applicable law. Subscriber agrees to pay all costs of collection, including any reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses.\n",
    "Adding Authorized Users. Filevine authorizes one (1) Authorized User per Filevine License. Authorized Users shall not share Logon Credentials at any time and Subscriber shall not permit Authorized Users to share Logon Credentials at any time. Subscriber may add additional Filevine Licenses at Subscriber's then-current rate for Filevine Licenses. Additional license fees will be prorated for the remainder of the then-current Term and added to Subscriber’s next invoice.\n",
    "Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Filevine’s fees and pricing are exclusive of taxes, levies, duties or similar assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal, or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). Without limiting the foregoing, Subscriber is responsible for all Taxes of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Subscriber hereunder, whether or not known to Subscriber and/or Filevine, other than, for clarity, any taxes imposed on Filevine’s income, property and employees. If Filevine has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Subscriber is responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Subscriber, unless Subscriber provides Filevine with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Subscriber shall indemnify and hold Filevine harmless from and against any penalties, interest, or other tax liability arising from (i) any failure by Subscriber to pay any applicable Taxes, and/or (ii) any tax exemption certificate provided by Subscriber under this Section 4.5.\n",
    "Disputes. Filevine must receive written notice of any disputed charges from Subscriber within five (5) days after the invoice date or Subscriber shall be deemed to have waived Subscriber’s right to dispute charges. Notwithstanding any dispute, Subscriber shall pay any undisputed amount of the invoice on or before the due date. Any dispute notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The Parties shall use best efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. \n",
    "Suspension of Service and Acceleration. If any amount owed by Subscriber under this or any other agreement for any Filevine Services is ten (10) or more days overdue, Filevine may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Subscriber’s unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and/or disable Subscriber’s and Subscriber's Authorized Users' Logon Credentials and suspend Subscriber’s and Subscriber’s Authorized Users' access to any services, including the Filevine Services, until such amounts are paid in full.\n",
    "Service Support\n",
    "Technical Support. Filevine shall provide Subscriber with unlimited access to the Filevine Help Center. Subscriber will also have access to email-based and online chat-based technical support services during Filevine’s regular business hours, 7:00 a.m.- 6:00 p.m. Monday to Friday U.S. Mountain Time, excluding U.S. holidays.\n",
    "Availability. Filevine will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to make the Filevine Services available at least ninety-nine percent (99.0%) of the time as measured over the course of each calendar month during the Term, except for: (a) scheduled maintenance; (b) unplanned downtime; (c) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Filevine’s reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, floods, fires, earthquakes, pandemics, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems, Internet or other cloud service provider failures or delays, or denial of service attacks, and (d) unavailability due to equipment or software not provided by Filevine (including any of Subscriber's equipment).\n",
    "Confidentiality\n",
    "Neither Party shall (i) disclose to any unaffiliated third party any Confidential Information; or (ii) use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than that indicated in this Agreement without the Disclosing Party’s prior written approval. The Receiving Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party, using the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care). The Receiving Party agrees to notify the Disclosing Party promptly of any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and to assist the Receiving Party in remedying any such unauthorized disclosure. The Receiving Party agrees that all persons having access to the Confidential Information under this Agreement will abide by the obligations set forth in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict the Parties from disclosing Confidential Information as required by law or court order or other governmental order or request, provided in each case the Party requested to make such disclosure shall timely inform the other Party and use all reasonable efforts to limit the disclosure and maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information to the extent possible. In addition, the Party required to make such disclosure shall permit the other Party to attempt to limit such disclosure by appropriate legal means.\n",
    "Neither Party will disclose to the other Party any third-party confidential information without first obtaining the written consent of such third party.\n",
    "All Confidential Information disclosed hereunder shall remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party shall have no interest in or rights with respect thereto except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\n",
    "Filevine may contract with third parties or subcontractors as Filevine deems appropriate to perform its obligations and/or services under this Agreement, including without limitation marketing assistance, e-mail delivery, hosting, back-up and recovery services, customer service, implementation, data migration and data analysis and shall have the right to disclose Subscriber’s Confidential Information to such third party in connection with their performance of services on Filevine’s or Subscriber's behalf. Filevine will require any third-party service providers or subcontractors maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information disclosed to them and such third parties or contractors are not permitted to use Confidential Information for any purpose other than to provide services to Filevine.  Filevine will remain primarily liable to Subscriber for the performance of such subcontractors; provided, however, that this sentence does not apply to any third party with whom Subscriber directly contracts for implementation, migration or other services.\n",
    "The Parties agree that unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information would be a material breach of this Agreement, may cause irreparable harm to Disclosing Party and that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief seeking to restrain such use or disclosure without the necessity of posting any bond.\n",
    "The provisions in this Section 6 shall survive for seven (7) years after termination of this Agreement, except that with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret as defined under applicable law, the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its obligations under this Section 6 for so long as such information continues to be eligible for trade secret protection under applicable law, but in no event for a period of less than the seven (7) year period specified immediately above.\n",

This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Utah without giving effect to any choice of law rule. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. Except as set forth in this Section 10.1, each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the mandatory and exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah, with venue proper only in Salt Lake County, Utah.
