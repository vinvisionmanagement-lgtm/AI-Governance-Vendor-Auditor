Payment for services may be made via credit card, standing order or Paypal. Kamatera reserves the right to add, modify, or remove payment methods at its sole discretion. If a new customer is unable to complete our standard credit card verification (including 3D Secure), they can still get started with a prepaid account. Prepaid customers continue to enjoy the benefit of a free first month. To activate the trial, we kindly ask for a fully refundable $10.00 USD deposit. This deposit is returned in full if the account is canceled within the 30-day trial period. If charges are processed in a currency which is not the same currency as published, the conversion rate of the first invoice will be defined as the minimum conversion rate of all future invoices. All Israeli local customer(s) will be charged in local ILS currency according to Bank Leumi’s exchange rate for checks / transfers – sell. Despite the above, the exchange rate will not decrease from 3.70 ILS to 1.00 US$ and will not exceed 4.30 ILS to 1.00 ILS, plus applicable local Israel Value-Added Tax. On all the above, will be added 2% of the invoice amount, for an administration fee. Products and Services are billed automatically on a monthly recurring basis. If you were approved for a free trial or any promotional offers, you are hereby notified that upon expiration date of such trial or promotion your services will be deemed chargeable unless you terminate all active servers or services from your account. From time to time, due to change of prices which are unrelated to Kamatera, such as, change in tax rates, electricity rates, third parties’ licensing rates and/or otherwise, Kamatera expressly reserves the right to change and modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted to Customer contact details and effective immediately. To remove any doubt, in the event that the Customer have purchased or obtained Products and Services for a long term, such as a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective immediately upon Kamatera’s decision of such changes. Kamatera shall update its customers accordingly at its discretion, via email and/or in the invoice. The customer agrees to receive updates on changes to the terms of engagement, including, without limitation, commercial terms, service terms, or any other terms, via email, or with the periodic invoice, as shall be determined by the company. You may cancel specific products and services at any time. Please note the following: For hourly services, charges are on a “pay-as-you-go” basis. Therefore, you will not incur further charges once the service is terminated. For monthly services, no refunds are issued for the current month as you have prepaid for the full month, but billing will cease for subsequent months. If you cancel a product or service that includes a license or add-on, no partial refunds will be issued for the current billing cycle, regardless of whether the service is hourly or monthly. In case that the customer has paid a deposit in advance to Kamatera, if the customer does not use this deposit to receive services from Kamatera for at least 6 months, Kamatera will charge the customer 2% of the deposit every month, and after 30 months, the deposit will be deleted, and the customer will not be able to use it for Kamatera’s services. Customer shall also pay to Kamatera all expenses incurred by Kamatera in exercising any of its rights under the Terms or applicable law with respect to the collection of a payment default, including attorneys’ fees, court costs and collection agency fees. All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted, even if the Products and Services are suspended or terminated prior to the end of the Products and Services term. Notwithstanding anything contrary, failure to pay any of the Customer’s fees is a material breach by the Customer of these Terms.
